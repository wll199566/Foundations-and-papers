# Non-trivial Details in papers

## Models

1. For the binary classification problem, if the number of the final output is one, then the activation function is sigmoid function, if it is two, then softmax function.

## Evaluation

1. Awesome and vivid [explanation](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-confusion-matrix-a9ad42dcfd62) of Confusion Matrix, which includes **recall** and **precision**.
2. AUC-ROC curve is always used to evaluate the performance of **classification** model. An awesome explanation can be found [here](https://www.dataschool.io/roc-curves-and-auc-explained/), and the recommended paper is [here](https://people.inf.elte.hu/kiss/13dwhdm/roc.pdf).
